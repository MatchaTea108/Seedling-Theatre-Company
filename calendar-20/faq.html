              <h1>My child really wants to act on the stage/sing in front of an audience/be a star 24/7, but she doesn’t have any real experience or training. Are your programs appropriate for them?</h1>
              <p>Absolutely. We have one top performing class, our Showcase Cast, which utilizes an audition-only casting process each semester. Other than that, all our programs are designed to bring out the confident performer in each child, regardless of experience or current ability level. We are continually adjusting and re-structuring our classes to address the needs of the students and are dedicated to focusing on the individual development of each child first and foremost.</p>
              
              <h1>Where will my child’s shows be performed at the end of the semester?</h1>
              <p>At our studio, the same place we hold classes every week. We have a 125 person audience capacity theater fully equipped with wireless body mics, sound system, stage lighting, and an endless inventory of costumes, props, and sets on hand right there in our 5400sq. ft. warehouse. The students practice every week on the same stage they perform on and we are able to keep production costs down by providing our own venue.</p>
              
              <h1>I’m concerned that my child will just be sitting around in class doing nothing while the principle characters are rehearsing. How does your company address this issue?</h1>
              <p>Whenever any cast is rehearsing for a show there is always going to be times when some cast members are not required to be on stage. That is the nature of the beast but it can be frustrating for parents and students alike. This issue has always been at the top of our priority list in developing our curriculum and classroom structure, and there are many ways we are continually working to minimize wasted class time.<br><br>

              Skill building activities and theatre games are utilized each week in addition to show rehearsing.<br><br>

              Having at least <strong>two instructors in each theatre class</strong> enables multiple groups to rehearse at the same time, making use of our dance room and vocal rooms when available in addition to the theater itself.<br><br>

              <strong>Smaller classes, more responsibility.</strong> Once we have the minimum cast requirements we close that class and label it FULL. Whenever possible we will give a student two smaller roles before adding another student to the class. When an ensemble group is needed, we try to offer a separate group specifically for students who would like to be more involved with singing and dancing. Often we have them perform with multiple casts as an added incentive to going the ensemble route.<br><br>

              Memorizing lines and lyrics, practicing scenes with a partner or in small groups, and writing down stage directions and performance details in their scripts are all important activities we encourage students to initiate on their own when not on stage.<br><br>

              Whenever possible, students are given the opportunity to help with <strong>set and/or costume projects</strong> during down time in class. If they are offered, encourage your child to participate. Creating a sense of ownership in a production builds respect for all aspects of the theatre and may lead to untapped interests.<br><br>

              Our emphasis, especially with the older kids, is on <u> personal responsibility regarding time management.</u> Ultimately, it is the student’s choice whether they take advantage of the opportunities presented them each week they come to class. We strive to create an actual learning environment and those students we have seen make the most progress in their performance abilities are the ones who pay attention to what is occurring on stage, even if they are sitting in the audience. There is a wealth of information, great advice, and universal performing concepts being disseminated each week in class. All of it is applicable to each and every student.</p>
